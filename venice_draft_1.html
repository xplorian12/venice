<h2>
General Overview
</h2>
<div class="columns-2">

<p>
As can be observed from the graphs, all property types experienced a dip
in value between 2022 - 2023. While multifamily and single family homes
began 2025 with a strong rise, condos rose at a much lower rate..
</p>
<div class="columns-2">
<div>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<div>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The above charts show the median price for condos and single family
homes by bedroom count. you may notice an almost $1,000,000 difference
in value between 3 and 4 bedroom houses.
</p>
<h2>
Market Overview - Pricing &amp; Analysis
</h2>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Above we can see the $/sqft graph, again illustrating the 5 year
stagnation. as of August 2025, condos in Venice have a median
price-per-sqft of $950/sqft, SFRs go for a median of over $1,350/sqft,
and multifamily homes, seeing a decline since mid 2023, stand at around
$850/sqft.</p>
<h2>
Demand and Activity
</h2>
<div class="columns-2">
<div>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The above two charts show market volume, by dollar amount and sale
count. From the above two charts we can see that the market is dominated
by single family homes. While there was a dip in activity in 2023, the
market began to pick up again in mid 2024.</p>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above graph, showing median days-on-market by asset type, is a
good indicator of demand. The longer it takes to sell a home - the lower
the demand, and the more power buyers have. In the case of Venice, we
can observe a small rise in median DOM during 2024, and a small decline
in 2025, signifying a moderate market with increased demand. Coupled
with the increase in market activity from the previous section, market
power appears to be shifting towards sellers.</p>

<p>The above map shows sales in the last 2 year by price point and
location. As can be expected, concentration of high value sales can be
observed in the Venice Canals, but we can also observe some high value

(especially on Palms blvd).</p>

<p>The above pin map shows sales by asset type around Venice. We can
observe that single family homes are over represented east of Lincoln,
whereas multifamily units dominate closer to the ocean. Condos are
somewhat sprinkled around, but are more prevalent west of Lincoln.</p>
<p>The heatmap shows locations with quick sale activity - the redder the
mark, the faster it sells.</p>
<h2>
Rental Market Overview
</h3>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/lease_section-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Median lease prices in Venice have also been stagnating a bit. While
they continuously rise, they do so at a declining rate, almost
flattening at around $5,600 in July 2025.</p>
<div class="columns-2">

</div>
</div>
<p>The above 2 charts show the median lease price for various unit
sizes, for condos and SFRs. The jump in prices at the highest bedroom
count can be partly attributed to the low quantity of such units, rather
than size.</p>

<p>The above two graphs are ratio signals of the rental market from an
ownerâ€™s perspective. The higher a price/rent ratio is, the higher the
price of a property relative to lease price. While all property types
saw a dip in price/rent ratio during 2024, SFRs and multifamily homes
saw a sharp increase towards the end of 2024. Condos rose at a slow
pace.</p>
<p>Vacancy rate, signaling how easy it is to find tenants, is quite low
in Venice, just baerly surpassing the 1% line. This is evidence that
rental units in Venice are in high demand.</p>
<h2>
Market Composition and Demographics
</h2>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/mdr_acs_summary_updated-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The population of Venice has gotten a little older between 2013-2023.
While not a radical change, age groups above 55 years old have grown
quite significantly in the last decade. The lower percentage of
residents under 24 years old might indicate that families are looking
elsewhere.</p>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Median household income has been rising in the last decade,
flattening at around $120,000, exceeding the county median at
$87,760.</p>
<p><img src="venice_draft_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above graph shows the share of housing units that are rented vs
owner-occupied. While most units in Venice are occupied by renters, a
quite large portion of occupants own their home.</p>

<p>The above 3 graphs show show permit data from the last year. We can
see most permits we residential, and many were finaled. Very
interestingly, a lot of demolition permits were finaled, and a lot of
new construction permits were issued, all around the same time and with
similar numbers. This indicates a strong developer confidence in the
market.</p>

<h2>
Conclusions:
</h2>
<p>
<p>Following a small peak and drop around late 2022-early 2023, prices
of all property types in Venice are slowly rising, with condos rising
the slowest.</p>
<p>Demand for Venice real estate has been rising in the last two years,
as can be noted by the increased market activity and lower days on
market before sale. Multi family properties in particular are seeing a
sharp rise in demand.</p>
<p>In the last 2 years, most real estate sales in Venice were above
$1,000,000. Most expensive areas include the Canals, along the beach,
and insulated, quiet neighborhoods with large lots.Most single family
homes were sold east of Lincoln Blvd, whereas condos and multi-families
are more common west of it.</p>
<p>The rental market in Venice has been fairly steady, with lease prices
flattening at a median of around $5,600. Price-to-rent ratio, which
compares lease prices to sale prices, have increased for multi-families
and single family homes, which have seen a major dip in the last 3
years, implying sale prices increased faster than rental prices (condos
have remained steady). Vacancy has been quite low in Venice, hovering
around 1%, suggesting a strong demand for rentals.</p>
<p>The population of Venice has gotten older in the last decade, with
people ages 55+ growing at a slightly faster rate than younger age
groups. The median household income in Venice was estimated at around
$115,000 in 2023, which makes it a very affluent neighborhood. Around
two thirds of Venice houses are rented, whereas one third is
owner-occupied.</p>
<p>Quite a few residential new construction permits were Issued in the
last few years, and a lot of demolition permits were finaled, suggesting
a period of development.</p>
<p>Overall, Venice is experiencing slow but steady growth, a strong but
competitive rental market, and considerable development.</p>
